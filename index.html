<p>At the housing development where I dig holes, geese honk from the rooftops.</p>

<p>The houses--homes, I'm sure they were called by real-estate agents--and their uniformly curved streets comprise a dimension of regularly-spaced American flags and flocks of boys playing with baseballs and tonka trucks from precisely 2:45 to 6:00 PM, when fathers in slacks yell "time to eat!" I'm beginning to suspect that the neighborhood's inhabitants abort their female offspring, because girls here are beyond good children--they're neither seen nor heard. My brother suggests that the girls are just inside playing with dolls, per the consensus of the area. Silently? And how do they get from the bus to the door?</p>

<p>It is possible, I guess, that they simply bore seven boys and no girls by chance.</p>

<p>As for the geese, I can't tell if they're unflappable or high-strung. While I counted from zero to 85 (foot-deep holes), I witnessed one goose land on a rooftop and remain immobile and silent for three hours. It did not turn around. It did not waggle its neck. It did not shift its legs. However, at the end of three hours it turned toward me made the usual racket. The honking has a desperate quality, like an alarm, but they honk so consistently for so long that it becomes an tone of the air. Hearing geese gives a sense of the largeness of the sky, as they fly far overhead. But these geese buzz this neighboorhood in pairs. Up close, their graceful quality disappears. They're comic relief to the place, shitting on roofs and honking at golden retrievers (who predictably bark back).</p>

<p>How, after at least twenty springs like this (the houses can't be much older than that), do the roofs not have a thick encrustation of goose guano? Do they (hire someone to) clean their shingles every year?</p>
