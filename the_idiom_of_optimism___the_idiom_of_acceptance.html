<p><em>The Returned</em> is full of morbid irony. A resurrected butterfly has the strength to break its display case glass, and flies past a man dozing in front of the television.</p>

<p>"I drew this smile up on my face / I paved the road that will one day leave me lonely"</p>

<h1>Nothing in Between</h1>

<p>Kylie's "Into The Blue" could be the theme song to <em>The Returned</em>. "I drew this smile up on my face / I paved the road that will one day leave me lonely," she would sing, and then the school bus would drive off the cliff. Its lyrics sound either powerfully self-affirming or profoundly morbid: "Don't need no one to rescue me / Cause I'm not waiting up for no miracle." </p>

<p>I still have no idea what tea tastes like, or what it does. Does it depress, or stimulate, shock or soothe? Maybe I've never wondered anything else, really. The longer spent at something can just as easily leave one worse at it as better. From the outside, it seems to me that skill and carelessness are the same thing in marriage. I blind tasted cheap wine just a few hours ago, and past number four I couldn't tell you what any of them tasted like. And the first four, I recall only how others described them. It was an interesting notion of the emperical put to the test. It made at least one thing clear to me, that I have no taste. Our thumbs up or down were asked of us (one enterprising soul presented his thumb sideways, a captiulation to the binary I took up few times), and at no time did I know which. I undoubtedly took it too seriously. One taster told us that, lacking a childhood trauma, as a child he intentionally hurt himself. Everybody of course believes that he manufactured that story, not his Freudian subjectivity. I was extremely nervous of anyone finding out the emptiness of my preferences. But I would have been relieved, too.</p>

<p>Leave it to Kylie to further clarify the tea question. "Into The Blue" sounds either soaringly self-affirming or profoundly morbid. I don't know that there is anything in between. "Don't need no one to rescue me / Cause I aint' waiting up for no miracle / Yeah tonight I'm running free." Who doesn't want to be unhindered by dependence, but what is the absolute independance posed here but death? If one is no longer waiting for a miracle, what does one have besides looking forward to? (Much, I think, but that's another story.) What strikes me is how close hope sounds to acceptance here.</p>

<p>Tea can be offered at any time, as a motion to carry on. Leaving behind a tragedy, going back to work. Coffee has both a tighter association with working and more glamour as a commodity. It's an excess and a necessity. Coffee intake must be controlled, it's addictive and indefinably unhealthy, and yet how to get through a day without it. ("A cup of ambition," Dolly Parton calls it.) Tea, the same word for tea and non-tea, could be a comfort. It carries a certain dinginess that no amount of fancy tea shops will wash away, as if its cultural insipidness oddly survives infinite brewings. I'm probably just not understanding, but I think Kylie's song has just as strange a logic: "I'm still here holding on so tight to everything that I've left behind. I don't care if the world is mine, cause this is all I know." If she's mocking the version of herself that she's leaving behind, it has all the retentiveness of sarcasm. If she's giving up on having the world to more fully commit herself to her own small part of the world, that's an odd note of realism for a pop song to strike. What does one prepare oneself for by such broad acceptance of one's own limits? The blue, "where nobody knows, wherever the wind blows." The unknown is where the imagination ends or it's just the end. Either way, this is neither the dreams "they let you dream just to watch 'em shatter" or the "dreams he'll never take away" in Dolly's "9 to 5."</p>

<p>"Into The Blue" could be the theme song to <em>The Returned</em>. "I drew this smile up on my face / I paved the road that will one day leave me lonely," she would sing, and then the school bus would drive off the cliff. Any intimacy between optimism and giving up becomes pure irony in this show. Rather than a witless, groaning horde, the undead are just people no longer dead. The affliction seems more like the miracle Kylie is no longer waiting for, and those who survived dead family and friends are despreately attached to those deaths. A resurrected butterfly is strong enough to break its glass case. The first human the camera follows the butterfly to is dozing in front of the television. The first episode centers around the family of a girl who died in a school bus and then comes back months later. Her father goes to a support group consisting of all the parents of those that died in the bus. One of them says it has helped "not exactly get over our loss, but carry on, move forward." She's having a baby, of which she says "life always prevails." The show is essentially a chorus of "and how."</p>
