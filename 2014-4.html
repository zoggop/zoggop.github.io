<a href='dysgeusia.html'>Dysgeusia</a>
</h2>
<p>I see a bad moon rising, but I can't say that I see trouble on the way, per se. It's a bit hard to see through the tree branches, to be honest. But it looks more or less bad out the window. Commendations to the set artist are in order. I could go outside to get a better look, but that's not really playing fair, is it?</p>

<p>The dictionary gives the definition of dysgeusia as "dysfunction of the sense of taste," which is odd, considering it's listed as a symptom of thrush. Are you telling me, dictionary, that what I'm tasting isn't actually there? That I'm <em>sensing</em> it wrong? There <em>is</em> a bad taste in my mouth. If you sucked the fluid out of my mouth, I'm telling you, it's pH would be all wrong.</p>

<p>Or are you including physical interdiction of the taste apparatus (to match the obtuseness of your tongue) within a "dysfunction of the sense"? But that would mean tasting something bad, if you don't want to taste something bad, is a dysfunction. Eating spoiled food is a failure of taste, you are saying? That I, being a sophisticated a person as could be expected, should know better? That I should have avoided it before tasting it? That's just plain offensive, Merriam-Webster.</p>

<p>But maybe you're right about the whole problem of senses. Of not coming to them: The bad taste comes, the bad taste goes. Do I taste it at all anymore? I engineer little tests, swishing water and then <em>sensing</em> as hard as I can. Everything I taste then, concentrated on the task, takes on a certainty. I can for sure taste metal, there, on the left side. I can feel it seeping through my teeth, under my tongue, like dry ice gas.</p>

<p>Then again, it's easy to think it's not there. Distract with just a bit of food, a bit of work, a bit of something to complain about or celebrate, and I've forgotten it's there. Then take a sip of water, or put my head on the pillow, and there it is ("oh yes, it's definitely there", I think).</p>
