<p>To get a bit off topic (but then, I'm talking about a book whose plot revovles around Queen Victoria taking the throne, and at the same time insists upon the insignifigance of the crown to the texture of the protagonist's life), Theordore Decker in <em>The Goldfinch</em> is thirsty for anachronism, not tea. So much so, Donna Tartt's prose become almost unbearably wistful in the presence of antique eclecticism.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cinnamon-colored walls, rain on the windowpanes, vast quiet and a sense of depth and distance, like the varnish over the background of a nineteenth-century painting. Rugs worn to threats, painted Japanese fans and antique valentines flickering in the candlelight, Pierrots and doves and flower-garlanded hearts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that passage leaves you exasperated, you won't be able to stand the love of Theo's life, Pippa. Or at least, the way he thinks of her (this being in the first person, there is no escape from Theo's perspective): the kind of quirky, flighty, pretentious person who utters "lately I've been listening to Arvo Part, I have no idea why."</p>

<p>But she does not run on, does not stare uncomfortably, like Theo does at Pippa's red hair.</p>

<p>Themes of addiction couldn't be less new to the detective genre, but the Veronica Mars movie seems to assume so. But her voiceover in the movie isn't <em>just</em> on the nose. It's one of those bits of schmutz that no matter how much you cross your eyes, never look like anything. However bound a hard-boiled detective is to have an addictive personality, I'm used to it being a matter of subtext. Sarah Lund is drawn away from ostensible domestic bliss with her boyfriend in Sweden. The investigation does seem to be very much what Veronica would call a fix. But Veronica actually monologues in AA confessions. Kristen Bell makes this sound as arch as we expect, yet there is still something unsettling about hearing something romanticized (and complicated) by the genre--okay, by me--in such clinical terms.</p>

<p>Maybe bemusedly identifying herself as a heroic addict amounts to the same thing that obsessive detectives are usually up to. Rather than the addict being the monster who must confess, the addict is running around questioning people.</p>

<p>It would be a poor romance that consisted of ode after ode. As Diana says, writing romance is all about following the flirtation. I take this to mean that wit can create feeling, not so much the other way around. Peacock's love of the era is specific and uninflected by mourning or self-consciousness. There is a delight in Peacock's numerous descriptions of fashion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He wore a plum-coloured coat, a waist­coat in plum and sil­ver stripes, a white ruf­fled shirt and a sil­ver-grey cra­vat with a ruby and di­a­mond pin, breeches of finest buck­skin and beau­ti­ful boots of chest­nut leather, with soft tops or­na­mented with plum-coloured tas­sels to match the coat.
  This upturning of lifestyle sociology is</p>
</blockquote>

<p>, often consisting of those "empty" foods on which we like to pin our problems. (If you're eating them, you deserve what's coming to you.) The same foods that, to be dramatic, brought about Western civilization (in the case of bread), facilitate productivity (coffee), and modulate emotion (tea). Tea doesn't really fit in this list, does it?)</p>
